I want to provide some context around why I&amp;rsquo;ve decided that I need something more. The origins of this story reach way back to when I was younger I want to begin at the true turning point.
One day I was sitting looking at my bank account like many people do. I keep good track of my bills, I rarely ever subscribe to services, and I make good money working my day job.</description></item><item><title>Day 1 - Day Trading</title><link>https://KalebHawkins.github.io/KryoLogs/financial-freedom/01-trading/</link><pubDate>Tue, 08 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://KalebHawkins.github.io/KryoLogs/financial-freedom/01-trading/</guid><description>If you read my previous post then you&amp;rsquo;ll know that my first major step to becoming financially free was to educate myself. I needed to learn money. As strange as that sounds I never learned money. You probably didn&amp;rsquo;t either. I can almost guarantee you weren&amp;rsquo;t taught money in school. You were taught to work for money so you were taught skills, albeit, mostly useless skills depending on your current occupation.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://KalebHawkins.github.io/KryoLogs/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 07 Aug 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://KalebHawkins.github.io/KryoLogs/about/</guid><description>Welcome to KryoLogs. I should share a little bit about myself. I have few interest. One of the longest-running interests in my life has been technology. I&amp;rsquo;ve been very gifted with technology and have always known I would use it to make my living.
As I am writing, I am employed full-time as a Systems Engineer, at least, that is an official title. My actual duties are more in line with that of a site reliability engineer.</description></item><item><title>Openshift - Authentication Cluster Operator Degraded (OAuthServerRouteEndpointAccessibleControllerAvailable)</title><link>https://KalebHawkins.github.io/KryoLogs/posts/openshift/authentication-operator-degraded/</link><pubDate>Sat, 22 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://KalebHawkins.github.io/KryoLogs/posts/openshift/authentication-operator-degraded/</guid><description>Issue Summary When performing an oc get co the authentication cluster operator is reporting a degraded state with the following message.
OAuthServerRouteEndpointAccessibleControllerAvailable: Get &amp;#34;https://oauth-openshift.apps.zone.domain.com/healthz&amp;#34;: context deadline exceeded (Client.Timeout exceeded while awaiting headers) Root Cause This can be a result of many different things, network issues, domain name resolution issues, etc. In my case the authentication pods and authentication-operator pod running in the cluster were failing to reconciliate due to some node modifications.</description></item><item><title>Openshift - Working with vSphere Storage Classes</title><link>https://KalebHawkins.github.io/KryoLogs/posts/openshift/vsphere-storageclasses/</link><pubDate>Fri, 14 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://KalebHawkins.github.io/KryoLogs/posts/openshift/vsphere-storageclasses/</guid><description>In this post we are going to look at two different things. First, we will look at modifing the default datastore for our vsphere storage class. Second, we will look at creating storage classes that specify the datastore.
The Default Datastore This change will trigger the nodes to reboot. Always make sure you are in an open maintenaince window or that your applications are designed to work through pods migrating from node to node for less impact.</description></item><item><title>Openshift - Managing/Modifing Machinesets</title><link>https://KalebHawkins.github.io/KryoLogs/posts/openshift/machinesets/</link><pubDate>Wed, 12 Apr 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://KalebHawkins.github.io/KryoLogs/posts/openshift/machinesets/</guid><description>In this document we are going to review the process of modifing a machineset to increase resources, for this example we will be increasing memory.
Modify The Machineset In the first step we modify the machine set we want to modify. First we decide which machineset we want to modify we can get the machinesets using the following.
oc get machineset -n openshift-machine-api Now we want to modify our machineset&amp;rsquo;s memory.</description></item><item><title>Kubernetes - Minikube</title><link>https://KalebHawkins.github.io/KryoLogs/posts/tools/minikube/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://KalebHawkins.github.io/KryoLogs/posts/tools/minikube/</guid><description>Overview Installation Uninstallation Customize Cluster Minikube Add-Ons Set Minikube $HOME Preferenced Setup Overview Minikube is local Kubernetes, focusing on making it easy to learn and develop for Kubernetes.
