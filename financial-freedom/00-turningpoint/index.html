I want to provide some context around why I&rsquo;ve decided that I need something more. The origins of this story reach way back to when I was younger I want to begin at the true turning point.</p><p>One day I was sitting looking at my bank account like many people do. I keep good track of my bills, I rarely ever subscribe to services, and I make good money working my day job. Still, I&rsquo;m left wondering where all my money went. I spent hours going through budgeting apps trying to figure out where it was all going. The apps didn&rsquo;t help much at all. My money was being spent on essentials and bills.</p><p>I quickly realized that it didn&rsquo;t matter how hard you worked or what your salary is. In today&rsquo;s economy, you will just never make enough. I began looking at the IRA that I had obtained from my employer. The IRA received a 3% match, unfortunately, I had to change my employer so I no longer received that match. My IRA was sitting in a static state. Under the new employer, I was receiving a 401k and I funneled money into that instead.</p><p>The savings account I had through my bank received a whopping 0.01% APY. So my savings received a few cents every year. I was not pleased with the math. I wanted my money to be growing but it simply wasn&rsquo;t.</p><p>Naturally under stress due to the same financial situation, so many are faced with today, I started watching Tiktok to just zone out and forget my problems. Well, the algorithm never fails. I started getting all these videos for day trading and stock market investing, crypto and all the other make-money-online videos. At first, I dismissed most the videos because I&rsquo;d just been trained to see them as scams. The algorithm persited, I was flooded with different videos so eventually the curiosity got the best of me.</p><p>Tiktok was the turning point. I&rsquo;m not sure if I was motivated or if the internet was just rubbing it in my face that I hadn&rsquo;t seen the path sooner. Either way I was ready to start making more money then I knew what to do with.</p><p>I put myself into research mode. My new obsession was money. I wanted to make more of it and I wanted what I made to grow itself. When I get hyper-fixated on something I go literal weeks doing nothing but whatever it is I&rsquo;m obsessed with at that moment. There were some Tiktok videos I watched that featured some talks that Robert Kiyosaki had done. Those talks and interviews caught my interest so I decided to order Mr. Kiyosaki&rsquo;s book <a href=https://amzn.to/44Y4tst>Rich Dad Poor Dad (Amazon)</a>. Robert Kiyosaki teaches money. Something they do not teach you in school.</p><p>The rest of the content I was running into was affiliate marketing or day trading videos. I&rsquo;m not one for posting a ton of videos and stuff so affiliate marketing just didn&rsquo;t seem like a good pick for me. So I picked up a few trading books. The two most noteable books are the <a href=https://amzn.to/3YstIjT>The TAO of Trading (Amazon)</a> and <a href=https://amzn.to/45kiwYZ>How to Day Trade for a Living (Amazon)</a>.</p><p>My goal now was to increase my capital as quickly as possible with day trading. I traded with a paper account using the strategies from the books mentioned previously. I was pleased with the results. I moved to real money I was pleased with those results. Greed took over, I took a pretty large hit and lost a fair amount of money. I broke my risk management rules. It sucked but it didn&rsquo;t stop me from continuing my journey. I was the only one to blame for my loss. I slowed down the trading not only because of the loss but, I was doubting the strategies the more I tested them the more I felt like it was just random change and no real reason that price would do what it did. People make a living off these strategies they just didn&rsquo;t click with me.</p><p>Once again, The algorithm did not fail. I discovered The Inner Circle Trader (ICT) through Tiktok shortly after I began doubting myself. I&rsquo;ve only made it through a fraction of his content but my trading has made a world of difference and I&rsquo;ve almost regained the capital I&rsquo;ve lost. I stick to very strict rules and do not break them. He uses a slightly different risk mitigation strategy that I now live by. His strategy is by far the most accurate strategy I&rsquo;ve back-tested and I will continue to learn from this man&rsquo;s content until I understand it like the back of my hand. I still recommend the readings above if only to understand other strategies. In fact you need to understand those strategies to understand ICT&rsquo;s strategy.</p><p>This is my start. This is my beginning. These are the first steps I&rsquo;ve taken to become financially free. The accomplishments I&rsquo;ve made so far are listed below.</p><ul><li>I&rsquo;ve opened my mind to taking risks and managing those risks.</li><li>I&rsquo;ve realized there are 1001 ways to make money you just need to think and put in the work upfront.</li><li>I have moved all of my money into a place where it will grow at the quickest rate with no work involved.</li><li>I know where my money is at. I know where it is going. I know how it is growing.</li><li>I&rsquo;ve educated myself.</li></ul><p>I will post some links to books I have read and am currently reading. I will not post anything I have bought and read that I didn&rsquo;t find useful. I do not want to sell anyone anything but if you do purchase from the links below it is much appreciated.</p><p>Below are some of the books I have purchased and read cover to cover.</p><ul><li><a href=https://amzn.to/44Y4tst>Rich Dad Poor Dad (Amazon)</a></li><li><a href=https://amzn.to/3YstIjT>The TAO of Trading (Amazon)</a></li><li><a href=https://amzn.to/45kiwYZ>How to Day Trade for a Living (Amazon)</a></li><li><a href=https://amzn.to/3QDn8Fk>How to Swing Trade</a></li><li><a href=https://amzn.to/43ZlWPY>The 10X Rule</a></li><li><a href=https://amzn.to/3YpSpgY>Skip the Flip</a></li></ul><p>I have several other books I haven&rsquo;t made it to yet. The ones listed I have found valuable.</p><p>Using ICT&rsquo;s methods I trade options quite successfully. You can start on the first video of the 2023 mentorship and he lays out in what order you should navigate his content. This content is invaluable.</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/@InnerCircleTrader>The Inner Circle Trader (ICT) (Youtube)</a></li></ul><p>In the next post I&rsquo;ll be going into more detail on what I&rsquo;ve done with my money since I&rsquo;ve started this journey.
