I want to provide some context around why I&rsquo;ve decided that I needed something more. Though the origins of this story reach way back to when I was younger I want to begin at the true turning point.</p><p>One day I was sitting looking at my bank account like many people do. I keep good track of my bills, I rarely ever subscribe to services, and I make good money working my day job. Still, I&rsquo;m left wondering where all my money went. I spent hours going through budgeting apps to try to help me figure out where it is all going and ultimately this was just a waste of time.</p><p>I quickly realized that it didn&rsquo;t matter how hard you worked or what your salary is. In today&rsquo;s economy, you will just never make enough. I began looking at my savings and the IRA that I had obtained from a previous position. I did some math and was very disappointed with the results of where it&rsquo;d be in five years.</p><p>My savings account only collected 0.01% annual percentage. The savings account itself was depleting quickly because life happens. My IRA was no longer receiving a 3% employer match because I had changed my employer. There has to be a better way right?</p><p>Naturally under stress due to the same financial situation, so many are faced with today, I started watching Tiktok to just zone out and forget my problems. Ironically the algorithm never fails. I started getting all these videos for day trading and stock market profits, crypto and all the fluff. I also was flooded with videos of talks that Robert Kiyosaki has done. At this point, I put myself into research mode.</p><p>When I get hyper-fixated on something I go literal weeks doing nothing but whatever it is I&rsquo;m obsessed with at that moment. I decided to order Mr. Kiyosaki&rsquo;s book <a href=https://amzn.to/44Y4tst>Rich Dad Poor Dad (Amazon)</a>. I picked up a few trading books. To name a few <a href=https://amzn.to/3YstIjT>The TAO of Trading (Amazon)</a> and <a href=https://amzn.to/45kiwYZ>How to Day Trade for a Living (Amazon)</a>.</p><p>I read Mr. Kiyosaki&rsquo;s book and just absorbed everything written. I started looking at real estate and ways to make money in it using his method and realized with the interest rates today I didn&rsquo;t have enough capital to make a profit. Given most of his content is to use other people&rsquo;s money I simply don&rsquo;t have investors.</p><p>My goal now was to increase my capital as quickly as possible. How could I do this? One of the stories in Robert&rsquo;s books I took very seriously. In summary, he talks about how he worked at a store for literally nothing and noticed they would cut the covers off comic books and through them in the trash to obtain credit from the merchant. Robert asked the owner if he could have the trashed comics and the owner agreed as long as they didn&rsquo;t resell them. They outsmarted the system and set up a library in his mother&rsquo;s house and rented the comics to kids around the neighborhood. What I gathered from this story is you can make money from literally anything if you think the right way. Which I believe is the whole premise of the book.</p><p>I started looking at the quickest way to lose or gain money. Day trading and swing trading. I had previously used <a href=https://join.robinhood.com/kalebh19>Robinhood</a> and lost a little and I never looked at it again. I am not a long-term investor by any means. I began reading the books previously mentioned and was pleased with my initial results trading again. I dove in and started looking at brokers and all that stuff. I came to find out that Robinhood offered a 1.5% APY on any uninvested cash. They also offered 4.65% APY for gold members. This was way better than what I was making in my saving and IRA.</p><p>I sat and thought about it for days and finally, I made a decision and weighed the pros and the cons. I took the tax hit and withdrew my IRA and all of my savings and put it into Robinhood for the interest gain of uninvested cash. I set a limit on what I could use of that equity to trade with. I had very strict rules. So what happened? Greed, I took a pretty large hit and broke my rules it hurt mentally. I then went back into research mode because the risk was just too great.</p><p>Again, through Tiktok, I discovered TheInnerCircleTrader (ICT). I&rsquo;ve only made it through a fraction of his content but my trading has made a world of difference and I&rsquo;ve almost regained the capital I&rsquo;ve lost. I stick to very strict rules now and in the past two days as of this writing, I&rsquo;ve made realized profits of over $1,000. His strategy is by far the most accurate strategy I&rsquo;ve back-tested and I will continue to learn from this man&rsquo;s content until I understand it like the back of my hand. I still recommend the readings above if only to understand other strategies.</p><p>I started having trouble with Robinhood with my newfound style of trading and discovered <a href=https://a.webull.com/KFgte9M9JAXue0sshX>Webull</a>. Webull offers 5.0% APY on uninvested no subscription required. So I took a large portion of what I had in Robinhood and transferred it over to Webull. I keep Robinhood for crypto trading and long-term investments while I use Webull for technical analysis and day trading. This seems to be the match for me as it is working out very well. Trading is by far the hardest way to make money. Not because it is difficult but because you have to manage your emotions very well when trading you cannot deviate from your strategy and you must cut loses quick.</p><p>These are the first steps I&rsquo;ve taken to become financially free. They are small steps but they are steps. I&rsquo;ve spent many weeks studying trading and using a paper trading account. I treated it like it was my hard-earned money. I am now trading with my hard-earned money and seeing the benefits of the work I put into studying the strategies. I take small losses and make big gains.</p><p>The accomplishments so far are as follows.</p><ul><li>I&rsquo;ve opened my mind to taking risks and managing those risks.</li><li>I&rsquo;ve realized there are 1001 ways to make money fairly quickly you just need to think and put in the work upfront.</li><li>I have moved all of my money into a place where it will grow at the quickest rate with no work involved.</li><li>I know where my money is at. I know where it is going. I know how it is growing.</li></ul><p>Below I will post some links to books I have read and am currently reading. I will only make recommendations I things I find useful and truly helpful. I do not want to sell anyone anything but if you do purchase from the links below it is much appreciated. In the next post, I will walk through a new source of revenue I am hoping will grow using Amazon&rsquo;s Affiliate program. I do want to say I do not provide financial advice. I am only documenting and sharing my journey. In other posts, I plan to share trades I&rsquo;ve taken. Wins and losses. I want to be as transparent as possible.</p><p>Below are some of the books I have purchased and read cover to cover.</p><ul><li><a href=https://amzn.to/44Y4tst>Rich Dad Poor Dad (Amazon)</a></li><li><a href=https://amzn.to/3YstIjT>The TAO of Trading (Amazon)</a></li><li><a href=https://amzn.to/45kiwYZ>How to Day Trade for a Living (Amazon)</a></li><li><a href=https://amzn.to/3QDn8Fk>How to Swing Trade</a></li><li><a href=https://amzn.to/43ZlWPY>The 10X Rule</a></li><li><a href=https://amzn.to/3YpSpgY>Skip the Flip</a></li></ul><p>I have several other books I haven&rsquo;t made it to yet. As I make it through them I will provide my reviews here. All the ones above I&rsquo;ve read and have found valuable information in them.</p><p>Free trading content I owe all of my recent trading success is here. Using ICT&rsquo;s methods I trade options quite successfully. You can start on the first video of the 2023 mentorship and he lays out in what order you should navigate his content. This content is invaluable.</p><ul><li><a href=https://www.youtube.com/@InnerCircleTrader>The Inner Circle Trader (ICT) (Youtube)</a></li></ul><p>I want to offer my referral links to Webull and Robinhood as well. If you do anything with little to no risk just put your money here and out of the bank&rsquo;s savings account. You will gain more interest and you will see money growth month to month off interest alone.</p><ul><li><a href=https://a.webull.com/KFgte9M9JAXue0sshX>Webull</a></li><li><a href=https://join.robinhood.com/kalebh19>Robinhood</a></li></ul><p>I hope this post helps motivate you to push yourself to provide yourself with a better future. Thank you for reading. I look forward to posting my progress and sharing it with everyone who reads it.</p></div></article></main></div><footer class=footer><span class=footer_item></span>&nbsp;<div class=footer_social-icons><a href=https://github.com/KalebHawkins target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer me" title=Github><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M9 19c-5 1.5-5-2.5-7-3m14 6v-3.87a3.37 3.37.0 00-.94-2.61c3.14-.35 6.44-1.54 6.44-7A5.44 5.44.0 0020 4.77 5.07 5.07.0 0019.91 1S18.73.65 16 2.48a13.38 13.38.0 00-7 0C6.27.65 5.09 1 5.09 1A5.07 5.07.0 005 4.77 5.44 5.44.0 003.5 8.55c0 5.42 3.3 6.61 6.44 7A3.37 3.37.0 009 18.13V22"/></svg></a><a href=https://www.tiktok.com/@kryotek target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer me" title=Tiktok><svg version="1.0" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" fill="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" viewBox="0 0 76 76"><path d="M65.9 19.4c1.4.2 2.8.1 2.8.1s0 6.2.0 12.2c-6.3.0-12.1-2-16.8-5.4V51c.1 20-24.6 29.8-38.3 15.6-14.7-15.1-2.1-40.5 19-37.7v12.3c-9.5-3-17.2 8-11.2 15.9 5.8 7.7 18.3 3.6 18.3-6.1v-48.2c2.4.0 9.9.0 12.2.0v1.6c.7 7.4 6.1 13.4 13.3 15v0C65.4 19.3 65.6 19.4 65.9 19.4z"/></svg></a><a href=mailto:KalebHawkins@outlook.com target=_blank rel="noopener noreferrer me" title=Email><svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 21" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M4 4h16c1.1.0 2 .9 2 2v12c0 1.1-.9 2-2 2H4c-1.1.0-2-.9-2-2V6c0-1.1.9-2 2-2z"/><polyline points="22,6 12,13 2,6"/></svg></a></div><small class=footer_copyright>© 2023 Kryotek.
